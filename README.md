# DSP-Audio-Frequency-Band-Detection
This project implements a real-time audio spectrum analysis system using the TMS320C6713 floating-point DSP processor. The system samples live audio at 8 kHz, performs a 256-point Radix-2 FFT, computes frequency band energies, and visually indicates the dominant frequency band using onboard LEDs.
